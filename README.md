#Text 2 speech

Maybe this will work
Used an english to IPA dictionary i found on github. 
you can find it here https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict


To fix:
all r sounds
ə
o and ʊ are a little weird
ɔ

Revisiting: need to do more research on phonetics before aimlessly throwing sounds together and hoping it works. look into linear predictive code speech synthesis as a foundation for rudimentary speech synthesis. Then look into this playlist as it seems comprehensive
